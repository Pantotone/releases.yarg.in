      "summary": "Convert SongContainer to a static class (#715)",
      "description": "The lifetime for access to all the variables contained in the class spans the entire uptime of the app. Having them all be statically accessible directly from the class itself instead of indirectly through a GlobalVariables instance makes operations on it easier to follow.\r\n\r\n+ Extra benefit on fewer allocations through not having to create new lists."
