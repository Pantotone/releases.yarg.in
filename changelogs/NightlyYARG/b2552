      "description": "* Move \"Insensity\" instrument icon shortcut to Right-Click\r\n\r\nTemporary measure until a better sorting/filtering system is in place\r\n\r\nReplaces Left-Click with prior broad filter behavior\r\n\r\n* Address incorrect intensity overrides\r\n\r\n+ Won't force a cache update, but a clear cache is required to apply the fix."
