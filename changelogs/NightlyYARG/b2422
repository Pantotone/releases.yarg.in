      "description": "Apply exponential scaling onto only the final mix instead of every stem.\n\nNote: we use exponential scaling for `<1` due to how human hearing works. The 50% that Bass provides in linear scaling does not actually give the impression of \"50% volume\" considering humans don't hear in linear space. It *has* to map to a slightly lower value for it to truly feel appropriate.\n\n+ Change the cases for \"processing threads\" switch\n+ Account for StemSettings changes for Master Volume\n+ Update YARG.Core"
