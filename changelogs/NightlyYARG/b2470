      "summary": "update 4L Cymbal binding strings to account for Lefty Flip (#757)",
      "description": "* Update Bindings_en-US.asset\r\n\r\n* correct typo\r\n\r\n* separate Green/Red Cymbal strings depending on Lefty toggle\r\n\r\nControlBinding can now hold an alternate name string, for display when profile has lefty-flip enabled. BindHeader will look at the profile's lefty setting, and adopt the appropriate string.\r\n\r\nUsing this, four-lane Green/Red Cymbal binding has been given separate labels for Green and Red.\r\n\r\n* correcting for style/conventions\r\n\r\nrenamed namelefty to nameLefty in several c'tors, and moved some curly braces on their own lines."
