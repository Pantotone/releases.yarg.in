      "description": "* Manage loading screens through a separate LoadingContext type\r\n\r\nThe type will handle the display and change of loading screen information. Having a dedicated type for this purpose means an instance can be passed around functions to directly change the loading screen information instead through an Action<> that holds a reference to the gameobject.\r\n\r\n+ Split the SongContainer refresh code into the SongContainer static class.\r\n\r\n* Remove LoadingContext refCount stuff\r\n\r\nIf you're using more than one context at a time, wtf is wrong with you\r\n\r\n* Rename IsLoading to IsActive\r\n\r\n* Fix variable names"
