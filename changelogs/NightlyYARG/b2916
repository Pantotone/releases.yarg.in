      "description": "* Fix venues shaders on OSX (again)\r\n\r\nPreviously we were exporting shaders for OSX separately.\r\nUnfortunately that does not seem to guarantee that all shader variants were exported.\r\nTo mitigate that we now export materials as well. However to avoid\r\ndoubling of resulting yarground size we replace all textures with dummy on export.\r\n\r\nLoading side does not change\r\n\r\n* Fix metal shader subbandle not included cause of wrong asset path\r\n\r\n* Add some logging for metal shader loading"
