      "description": "* Refactor Replay Collecting\r\n\r\n+ Deprecates prior replays (though they will still appear in the menu)\r\n+ Utilizes the now split ReplayInfo & ReplayData types from the inner Core refactor to read and collect files. Removes the ReplayEntry type.\r\n+ Consolidates ReplayViewType to handle BOTH replays and gamerecords\r\n\r\n* Move ReplayFrame creation to the player types\r\n\r\nNotice that the functions used in the overrides of the base abstract call.\r\n\r\nWould've been nice to be to therefore define it only once in a singular base class, but the architecture doesn't permit that. Oh well.\r\n\r\nAlso, forgot to add ProKeys writes lmao.\r\n\r\n* Funny nullable go brr\r\n\r\n* Replace `ReplayPresetContainer` with altered `ReplayData`\r\n\r\nCore updated `ReplayData` to contain the dictionaries that were present in the now removed `ReplayPresetContainer` type\r\n\r\n* Shuffle around ReplayViewType methods\r\n\r\n* Update to remove ReplayPlayerInfo middleman\r\n\r\n* Fix async of `ReplayViewType.ViewClick()`\r\n\r\n* Remove player & colorprofile IDs from ReplayFrame\r\n\r\n* Add YARGPlayer constructor for ReplayFrames\r\n\r\n* Simplify YargPlayer constructor with YargProfile\r\n\r\n* Incorporate new ReplayStats types\r\n\r\n+ Updates replay cache\r\n+ Alters CreateReplayFrame() to construct both the frame and replaystats.\r\n\r\n* Implement addition of SongSpeed to ReplayInfo\r\n\r\n+ Update replay cache version"

Doesn't work with harmonies yet, and doesn't seem to scale properly on solo vocals.\r\n\r\n* Implemented scaling on vocal guideline texture based on the highway's visible semi-tone range. Does not currently match the position of vocal notes, possible due to inconsistency in how these notes are positioned compared to the guideline texture\r\n\r\n* Fixed vocal range scaling for harmonies. Reimplemented range padding as a percentage of the current vocal range. Fixes vocal notes not matching the scale guidelines.\r\n\r\n* Changed TRACK_TOP for solo vocals.
